Sales Distribution by Payment Mode (Pie Chart):

- Explanation: This chart breaks down sales based on payment modes. Cash on Delivery (COD) represents the largest share of sales, followed by EMI (Equated Monthly Installments) and Credit Card.
- Pattern: COD is the most popular payment method, indicating a preference among customers for this option.
- Importance: Payment preference insights allow the manager to focus on customer experience improvements related to COD. Additionally, the manager may want to promote other payment methods, like Credit Card or EMI, through discounts or offers to encourage more secure and efficient transactions. This could reduce reliance on COD, which often incurs additional logistical costs.
