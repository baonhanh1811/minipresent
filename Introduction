# 1. Introduction
# The data consists of two CSV files: Orders.csv and Details.csv.
# Orders.csv contains basic information about customer orders, including order ID, order date, customer name, and location details (state and city).
# Details.csv includes more detailed data related to each order, such as order ID, amount, profit, quantity, product category and sub-category, and payment method.
# These data sets appear to track sales or order records, possibly from a retail or e-commerce platform, detailing the financial performance (amount and profit) of different product categories, along with the payment methods used for each transaction.
